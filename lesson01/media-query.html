            <p>"And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and ahappy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are bblessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and
                if they hold out cfaithful to the end they are received into dheaven, that thereby they may dwell with
                God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord
                God hath spoken it."</p>
